#### Course Objectives

1) To provide an understanding of basic many different research techniques and concepts related to scientific inquiry. 

2) To advance students along the research process by introducing the basic tools needed to critically analyze claims made through written and oral means, and determine the degree to which these claims are valid.

3) To help students not only in conducting research, but also in judging the validity of any claims made in articles and newspapers, trade journals, academic journals, briefings, presentations, and professional discussions.

4) To provide a foundation for students in designing and conducting their own research projects and determine how close to the truth they have come in their own efforts 

#### Course Schedule

Any collection of topics that I could have chosen to include in this course would have likely not been applicable to many of you.  So, rather than having try to guess what topics would be helpful to each of you...I'm devoting one class for you to discuss your research.  I've selected the names of each student registered for this class and randomly assigned them to a class period (see below)

What should you do with <u>YOUR</u> class?  It's up to you!  But, don't forget...<red>I assign your grades.</red>  Therefore, the better question might be...what do I think you should do with your class?  I'm glad you asked!  See the <a href='#grades'>Grades</a> section

# Grades <a name="grades"></a>

There will be four graded events in this course, each is described below

#### Homework

There will be homework assignments to ensure students are grasping the material.  Understanding of material is a subjective judgment based on the assignment you turn in to me.  If you show little or no work, or provide little explanation, I have no way of understanding how you arrived at your answer.  Effort is also a subjective judgment based on the professionalism of your work.  I expect that your assignments will be legible, free of misspellings, properly cited, etc.  

#### Quizzes

There will be multiple pop quizzes throughout the quarter.  The quizzes will be given to determine the extent to which students understand the assigned reading and homework material.  The quizzes will consist of approximately ten questions or problems.  

#### Exams

All exams will be administered in class and will be a closed book formatâ€”no reference materials, texts, equation sheets or notes will be allowed during the exams.  

A.  Mid-term Exam.  This exam will cover material contained in the first half of the quarter.  20-25% of the exam will cover important terms (i.e., vocabulary) that are discussed in the text or in class.  Another 20-25% will be short-answer questions that require the application of terms as given in scenarios.  The remaining 50-60% will require students to solve problems or address research issues.  The expected length of the exam is two hours.

B.  Final Exam.  The final exam will cover material mainly from the second half of the class and will be similar in format to the midterm exam.  While the final exam is not intended to be comprehensive, some of the material covered in the second half of the class is inextricably linked to the foundational concepts covered in the first half of the class.  Therefore, make sure you understand the foundational concepts well the first time.  The expected length of the exam will be two hours.


    + Identifying the <focus>specific</focus> result the research is intended to show

    + Understanding (streamlining) the research path

    + Understanding the structure of the data
