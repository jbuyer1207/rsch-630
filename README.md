#### Course Objectives

1) To provide an understanding of basic many different research techniques and concepts related to scientific inquiry. 

2) To advance students along the research process by introducing the basic tools needed to critically analyze claims made through written and oral means, and determine the degree to which these claims are valid.

3) To help students not only in conducting research, but also in judging the validity of any claims made in articles and newspapers, trade journals, academic journals, briefings, presentations, and professional discussions.

4) To provide a foundation for students in designing and conducting their own research projects and determine how close to the truth they have come in their own efforts 

#### Course Content

For any collection of topics that I could've chosen to include in this course, it's unlikely that those topics would be applicable everyone.  So, rather than trying to guess what topics would be helpful...I'm giving each of you one entire class to discuss your research.  

In my experience advising students (and being advised myself) it usually takes a two-hour meeting to hammer out the details for the research plan.  It helps me (as the advisor) to know that the student is proceeding on a solid path.  It helps the student as they often don't understand themselves what they're trying to achieve. This course will be a series of those meetings.

#### Course Schedule

I've randomly assigned each of you to a specific class period as shown in the table below.  This class period belongs to you and what you do with <u>YOUR</u> class is up to you!  But, don't forget...<red>I still assign your grades.</red>  Therefore, the better question might be...what do I think you should do with your class?  I'm glad you asked!

## Grading <a name="grades"></a>

There will be four graded events in this course, each of them are described below

#### The Initial Presentation (25%)

You will present a detailed overview of your research.  My expectation is that you DO NOT yet have a clear idea as to how to complete your research, so this initial presentation will be graded on completion. This means that as long as it's clear to me that you put forth a significant effort you will get a grade of 90% or above.  The details of what you should include in this presentation what represents a 'significant effort' are discussed [here](https://afit.shinyapps.io/rsch-630-day1).

#### Mid-Term Exam (25%)

On Wednesday, 4 May I will give a take-home exam covering topics discussed in the first 8 presentations (27 Apr & prior).  I won't ask nit-pick questions that pertain to one person's research.  The questions on the mid-term will test your understanding of how & when to use the analytical tools discussed in class 

#### The Final Presentation (25%)

Most AFIT students (including myself) make the research process harder than is necessary - usually for similar reasons.  However, after observing the other students work through the details of their research plans you should have a better understanding of how to work through the details of your research.  Therefore, I expect your final presentation to be more detailed and show a clear progression of how you will achieve your intended goals.  Therefore, I will grade this presentation in detail.

#### Final Exam (25%)

The final exam will cover material discussed during the second half of the class and will be similar in format to the midterm exam.  While the final exam is not intended to be comprehensive, some of the material covered in the second half of the class may be linked to the concepts covered in the first half of the class.  Therefore, make sure you understand the foundational concepts well the first time.
